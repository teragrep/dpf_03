# DPF_03

Holds a customized lexical tokenizer as a Spark UDF and a bloom filter aggregator.
Used to tokenize spark string columns and run Spark aggregation into a bloom filter with configurable filter size selection.

## Features

### TokenizerUDF

Spark UDF that will tokenize incoming string value and return it as a list of byte arrays.
Tokenization rules are set in blf_01.

### ByteArrayListAsStringListUDF

Spark UDF that converts results from TokenizerUDF into a list of strings.

### BloomFilterAggregator

Custom spark aggregator that aggregates a column string tokens into a single bloom filter and
returns the bytes of the resulting filter that can be processed.

Filter size is selected by giving the aggregator the name of a spark column that holds an estimated value of tokens and
by configuring a map of bloom filters with preset values (expected number of items, false positive probability).
